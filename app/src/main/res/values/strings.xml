Easypaisa Privacy Policy
1.1 The main security feature of the Service is the
five (5) digit MPIN, which You use to authenticate and
authorize transaction requests from Your Registered
Branchless Banking account number. In addition,
for certain transactions, You will be provided with a
unique transaction reference number and passcode.
1.2 The security of the MPIN must not be endangered
or compromised by choosing a MPIN that can be
easily guessed, such as five (5) of the same numbers
or numbers in sequence such as 12345.
1.3 You must not under any circumstances store Your
MPIN (or passcode) on Your Branchless handset in
any way whatsoever. If Your handset automatically
stores Your MPIN (or passcode), the onus is on
You to delete it. This will ensure that no one can
transact using Your Registered Branchless Banking
account number, as they will need Your MPIN and/or
passcode to complete and authorize transactions.
1.4 You are responsible for the security of the MPIN
and passcode (if applicable) and may not disclose the
MOPIN or passcode to anyone.
1.5 If anyone obtains Your MOPIN and/or passcode
and SIM with the Registered Branchless Banking
account number, it will be assumed that this person
is You. From our perspective, any transactions
authorised by this other person are legitimate and will
be acted on. You will be liable for any transactions
processed during this period until You advise us to</string>
